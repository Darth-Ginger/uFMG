## Assembly Definitions

Implementing Assembly Definition (`.asmdef`) files enhances compile times and enforces modularity. Place `.asmdef` files in the following directories:

- **Scripts/Core/World/World.asmdef**: For world data structures.
- **Scripts/Core/Maps/Maps.asmdef**: For map-related classes.
- **Scripts/Core/Terrain/Terrain.asmdef**: For terrain generation and visualization.
- **Scripts/Core/Environment/Environment.asmdef**: For environmental simulations.
- **Scripts/Managers/Managers.asmdef**: For management and controller scripts.
- **Scripts/Utilities/Utilities.asmdef**: For utility scripts.
- **Scripts/Editor/Editor.asmdef**: For editor-specific scripts.

## Best Practices

- **Separation of Internal and External Assets**: Keep your assets separate from third-party ones to avoid version control issues and maintain clarity.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use clear and consistent naming for folders and files to facilitate navigation and collaboration.
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related scripts and assets together to reflect their functionality and relationships within the project.
- **Assembly References**: Define explicit dependencies between assemblies to manage code access and reduce compilation times.

By adopting this structured approach, your project will be well-organized, making development more efficient and collaborative.
