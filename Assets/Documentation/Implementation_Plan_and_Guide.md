# Implementation Plan and Guide for Fantasy Map Generator Refactor

This guide outlines the next steps and priorities for refactoring the Fantasy Map Generator project to enhance modularity, flexibility, and scalability.

---

## 1. **Establish Project Goals**

### Primary Goals

- Modularize the codebase to allow independent development of features (e.g., landmass generation, climate simulation).
- Improve computational efficiency through threading/multiprocessing for heavy operations.
- Enhance flexibility by implementing scalable data structures like graphs or modular templates for varying map types.

### Secondary Goals

- Introduce debugging and visualization tools for real-time testing of map generation.
- Expand the framework to support future features such as custom biome generation, advanced erosion models, or social simulations.

## 2. **Core Components Overview**

### **2.1 Data Structure Refinement**

#### Current State

- The `WorldData` class contains data storage logic but lacks support for advanced data structures such as graphs or hierarchical maps.

#### Actions

1. Refactor the `WorldData` class:
   - Implement an abstract base class for map types.
   - Support multiple data storage formats (2D grids, Voronoi diagrams, graphs).
2. Add a boolean flag to initialize a graph-based structure when required.
3. Define default maps:
   - Longitude/latitude map
   - Voronoi map
   - Terrain map
   - Temperature map
   - Precipitation map

### **2.2 Modular Generation Modules**

#### Current State

- Map generation processes are loosely connected, reducing their reusability and efficiency.

#### Actions

1. Create a modular "World Machine" manager to coordinate processes like landmass, temperature, and precipitation generation.
2. Use dependency injection to decouple individual generators from the central manager.
3. Refactor existing generation algorithms into reusable modules with clear inputs/outputs.

### **2.3 Noise and Tectonics Enhancements**

#### Current State

- Noise-based heightmap generation is in place, but tectonic logic is limited.

#### Actions

1. Introduce a `NoiseGenerator` class to handle operations like Perlin noise, erosion, and tectonic simulations.
2. Optimize noise operations for threading/multiprocessing to improve performance.
3. Test combining Voronoi regions during tectonic simulation for realistic features such as oceanic shelves or plateaus.

## 3. **Tooling and Debugging**

### **3.1 Visualization Tools**

#### Actions

1. Integrate real-time visualizations for:
   - Heightmap generation
   - Temperature and precipitation layers
   - Biome distribution
2. Provide toggleable layers for debugging (e.g., view only tectonic plates or temperature zones).

### **3.2 Testing Utilities**

#### Actions

1. Build unit tests for individual modules.
2. Develop integration tests for end-to-end map generation.
3. Create benchmarks to measure the performance of noise and tectonic operations.

## 4. **Graph-Based Features and Serialization**

### **4.1 Graph Integration**

#### Actions

1. Add methods to initialize maps as graphs using libraries like NetworkX.
2. Experiment with graph-based storage for terrain features, population distribution, and other dynamic simulations.
3. Ensure compatibility with serialization for graph-based maps to facilitate save/load functionality.

### **4.2 Serialization Testing**

#### Actions

1. Test graph serialization with varying node and edge counts.
2. Measure performance for loading/saving large-scale maps.
3. Validate compatibility with modular generation components.

## 5. **Roadmap for Future Features**

### **5.1 Biome-Specific Generation**

1. Implement rules for biome placement based on temperature, precipitation, and elevation.
2. Add edge cases for extreme biomes like deserts, tundras, or rainforests.

### **5.2 Advanced Erosion Models**

1. Experiment with hydraulic and wind erosion algorithms.
2. Refactor erosion models for modular usage.

### **5.3 Social Simulations**

1. Prototype simple settlement placement algorithms.
2. Explore interactions between settlements and environment (e.g., resource usage, trade routes).

## 7. **Actionable Next Steps**

1. Refactor the `WorldData` class to support abstract map structures.
2. Begin modularization of generation modules, starting with landmass generation.
3. Develop a `NoiseGenerator` class with threading support.
4. Create a basic visualization tool for debugging heightmaps.
5. Establish unit tests for the refactored components.
